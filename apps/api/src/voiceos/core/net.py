"""Where a configured URL really points, judged the way the operating system resolves it.

Provider base URLs and the webhook tool are fetched from inside the deployment, so a URL
aimed at instance metadata would hand out the task's credentials. Hosts are canonicalized
first: glibc and macOS accept IPv4 written as one integer (2852039166), in hex
(0xa9fea9fe), in octal (0251.0376.0251.0376) or with a trailing dot, and every one of those
is 169.254.169.254.
